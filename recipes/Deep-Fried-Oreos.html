    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="text">Deep-fried Oreos are a carnival favorite where I grew up. Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried — yummy! You can do this with or without a deep fryer.</p>
        <p class="text">These fried Oreos are best eaten the day they're made. However, if you have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days.</p>
