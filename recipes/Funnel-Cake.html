    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="text">A funnel cake is a popular dessert made by frying batter. Commonly served at carnivals and amusement parks, funnel cakes (as we know them today) originated in Pennsylvania in the late 1800s. The fried dessert is liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar before serving.</p>
      <p class="text">Funnel cakes are best served fresh. However, if you have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. Reheat them in the oven instead of the microwave to crisp them back up.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul class="text">
        <li>Oil: You'll need about a quart of vegetable oil for frying the funnel cakes.</li>
        <li>Milk: Milk lends moisture, ensuring a perfectly tender funnel cake.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Two eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they act as a binder for the batter.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the funnel cake batter.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
        <li>Cinnamon and salt: Ground cinnamon and a pinch of salt enhance the overall flavor of the funnel cakes.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Sprinkle the funnel cakes with powdered sugar (a.k.a. confectioners' sugar) right before serving.</li>
     </ul>
